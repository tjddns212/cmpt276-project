Project Name: "RoomLink" - Shared House Community Platform 


**Abstract:** RoomLink is a web application designed as a shared house community platform specifically tailored to meet the needs of international students in Vancouver. The platform aims to simplify the process of finding suitable shared accommodations by connecting students seeking housing with available rooms in shared houses. It provides transparency, facilitates communication, and enhances the overall housing experience for international students. 



**Existing Systems:** Currently, international students in Vancouver face challenges in finding suitable shared accommodations. Existing platforms lack specialized features and comprehensive information about houses and housemates. What distinguishes this application from other similar services is that this application will focus exclusively on international students to assist them with finding accommodation. RoomLink aims to address these limitations by providing a dedicated platform that streamlines the housing search process for international students. It offers tailored features, comprehensive information, and safety measures to ensure a secure environment. By centralizing the search and enhancing transparency, RoomLink aims to simplify the process of finding shared accommodations for international students in Vancouver. 



**Improvements and Benefits:** RoomHub will improve the housing search experience for international students by offering the following benefits: 
1. Centralized Platform: Students can access a single platform to search for available rooms, eliminating the need to navigate multiple sources and simplifying the process. 
2. Detailed Room Listings: Homeowners can create comprehensive room listings, including location, size, amenities, rental price, and house rules, providing students with all the necessary information to make informed decisions. 
3. Roommate Matching: The platform's roommate matching feature will suggest compatible housemates based on preferences, interests, and lifestyle compatibility, fostering a harmonious living environment. 
4. Reviews and Ratings: Users can leave reviews and ratings for the houses they have lived in, providing valuable feedback to future tenants and ensuring transparency and accountability within the community. 
5. Communication and Safety: RoomHub will facilitate direct communication between students and homeowners through a built-in messaging system. Additionally, user verification measures will ensure a secure and trustworthy environment. 
6. Community Forum and Resources: The platform will include a community forum where users can seek advice, share experiences, and access helpful resources related to housing and living in Vancouver as international students. 



**Target Audience:** The target audience for RoomHub includes international students studying in Vancouver who are seeking shared accommodations. It caters to their specific needs and challenges, providing a platform tailored to their preferences and requirements. By focusing on this niche audience, RoomHub aims to offer a specialized solution that addresses their unique housing concerns.





**Scope of the Project:**


The project will contain several individual features/epics including a dynamic search process with various filters for suitable accommodations, an inbuilt chat system for international students seeking accommodation to be able to get in touch with homeowners, and several other features listed above in the improvements and benefits section.



**Sample Stories:**


1. As a user, I want to be able to view each of the available shared spaces in detail including things like a description of it, photos of the living space, and details about the homeowner.
2. As a user, I want to be able to search for and filter the available shared houses based on things like location, price, and amenities.
3. As a user, I want to be able to create a profile of myself which includes details about myself like my hobbies, preferences, and other interests so that I can connect with other housemates who are similar to myself. 
4. As a user I want to have a community forum where I can find important information, access important resources, and ask any questions I may have.
5. As a user I want to be able to message homeowners who are listing their available shared homes so that I can get in touch with them and ask any questions I may have.




The amount of work listed in this proposal is definitely enough for five members, and due to one member being missing we may have to potentially cut some features and prioritize the ones we feel are the most important in this application. We have many key features/epics that we intend on implementing and integrating together which will take a good deal of effort and consistency for us to complete over the three iterations.
